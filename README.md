## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to take a step back, understand that I don't know everything (and I never will), and that anything is google-able.

### Continued development

Concepts I'm not completely comfortable with and need to focus on are media queries, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped to remind me how to use certain CSS tools.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-svg-images-in-css-html/#:~:text=SVG%20images%20can%20be%20written,element%20in%20your%20HTML%20document.&text=body%3E-,If%20you%20did%20everything%20correctly%2C%20your%20webpage%20should,exactly%20like%20the%20demo%20below.) - This article reminded me about the embed tag and how I could use it to insert the shopping cart icon into the Add to Cart button.
